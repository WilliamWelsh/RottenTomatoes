### Overview
This Discord bot that allows you to search movies and TV shows on Rotten Tomatoes and view the critic score, audience score, and consensus. If you search for a celebrity, you will see how many certified fresh, fresh, rotten, and unscored movies they have, as well as their average score. You can also view the current top box office, movies opening this week, and movies coming soon to theaters. If you search a movie, and it's the only result, it will automatically display that movie.
